## Key Insights from the Thesis
1. **Prominence in Advocacy**: 
   - Prominence is a form of soft power reflecting an organization's perceived importance and influence, distinct from direct policy access.
   - This study operationalized prominence through mentions in legislative debates, analyzed using a supervised machine learning classifier.

2. **Main Findings**:
   - **Policy Saliency**: High-salience policy areas had a paradoxical association with lower prominence, suggesting that niche issues may offer more visibility opportunities for certain groups.
   - **Organizational Factors**: External lobbying emerged as a significant driver of prominence, overshadowing traditional assumptions about the influence of organizational age or size.
   - **Politician-Specific Dynamics**: Seniority and term status showed unexpected negative or mixed associations with granting prominence.

3. **Methodological Innovation**:
   - Leveraged nearly 78,000 legislative transcripts and employed supervised machine learning to classify mentions of interest groups, achieving an accuracy of 81% with an SVM classifier.

4. **Implications**:
   - Challenges the assumption that older or more established groups automatically hold greater prominence.
   - Highlights the importance of strategic lobbying and adapting to niche policy areas.

## Usage
These resources are intended for:
- **Researchers**: Interested in interest group dynamics and legislative influence.
- **Policymakers**: Seeking a nuanced understanding of advocacy group prominence.
- **Students**: Studying political science, public policy, or data-driven advocacy research.
