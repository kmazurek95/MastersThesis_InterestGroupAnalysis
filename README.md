## Key Features
- **Prominence Modeling**: Develops and analyzes models predicting interest group prominence in legislative debates.
- **Integrated Dataset**: Combines multiple data sources into a cohesive dataset for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Includes scripts to create impactful plots and charts to illustrate findings.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/MasterThesisUniversityOfAmsterdam.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to Subfolders**:
   - Review specific subfolders (`Data Collection`, `Preprocessing`, `Modeling`, etc.) for detailed scripts and their explanations.
3. **Run Scripts**:
   - Each folder contains README files or script headers describing usage and dependencies.

## Requirements
- **R**: `lme4`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `broom.mixed`, etc.
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, etc.

Refer to the subfolder-specific `README` files for more information.
